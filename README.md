# ProgrammingProjectNOV2019
Repository for the Project for the programming for data analytics November 2019





## 1. 30November2019
Creation of the Jupyter notebook and began preparing for the project.

## 2. 01Dec2019
Introduction to the QBD concept. Understanding which parameters will be simulated for the project.

## 3. 02Dec2019
Explanation of my real-life dataset. Imported required Python libraries.

## 4. 03Dec
Quick overview of project

## 5. 04DEC
Explained the theory of Cream consistency measurement and hte various inputs which impact cream consistency result. References were added. 

## 6. 05 Dec 1
Provide more of a background on my required dataset inclduing the distribution types.

## 7. 05Dec 2
Discussed some code to develop normally distributed data of a specific mean and standard deviation. I also tried to write code to make hte data more accurate eg having a long tail or truncated tail as per this reference: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-transform-data-to-fit-the-normal-distribution/

## 8. 07Dec
Continued working on the code to create long tail code for the LOD data. Devloped code to create a tail of 10 values. Need to look at ensuring it appends at the 1.0% which is the specification limit for this raw material.

## 9. 08Dec
adjusted LOD results to ensure data was below the NMT 1% specification limit. Remaining datasets were created using similar code.

## 10. 08Dec2
Finalised Poisson distribution for number of pH adjustments per batch ensuring specification limit of no more than 5 pH adjustments are performed per batch.

## 11. 08Dec3
Finalised all datasets and some formatting of the notebook. Researched how to create interactions between the simulated data.

## 12. 09Dec19
Performed some web research on characteristic relationships

## 13. 10Dec2019
Looked into sqlite to combine random variables into one table.
